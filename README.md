# DistLedger

Distributed Systems Project 2022/2023

## Authors

**Group A39**

### Code Identification

In all source files (namely in the *groupId*s of the POMs), replace __GXX__ with your group identifier. The group
identifier consists of either A or T followed by the group number - always two digits. This change is important for 
code dependency management, to ensure your code runs using the correct components and not someone else's.

## Getting Started

The overall system is made up of several modules. The main server is the _DistLedgerServer_. The clients are the _User_ 
and the _Admin_. The definition of messages and services is in the _Contract_. The future naming server
is the _NamingServer_.

See the [Project Statement](https://github.com/tecnico-distsys/DistLedger) for a complete domain and system description.

### Prerequisites

The Project is configured with Java 17 (which is only compatible with Maven >= 3.8), but if you want to use Java 11 you
can too -- just downgrade the version in the POMs.

To confirm that you have them installed and which versions they are, run in the terminal:

```s
javac -version
mvn -version
```

### Installation

To compile and install all modules:

```s
mvn clean install
```

### How to run the project

1) Open namingServer in its directory

```s
mvn compile exec:java
```

2) Open both server in different terminals

```s
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args="2001 A"
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args="2002 B"   
```

3) Open Admin and User in the corresponding directories

```s
mvn compile exec:java
```

### Debug

To compile and execute with debug:

```s
mvn clean compile exec:java -Ddebug
```

### Tests
